This project leverages a pre-trained model from Hugging Face for text summarization in conjunction with the AWS Cloud Development Kit (AWS CDK). By incorporating Hugging Face's powerful NLP capabilities, the solution enables accurate and efficient text summarization.

The Hugging Face pre-trained model serves as the core engine for generating summaries from input texts. These models are trained on vast amounts of data and have demonstrated state-of-the-art performance in natural language understanding and generation tasks. By incorporating the pre-trained model into the deployment process, the text summarization system benefits from Hugging Face's expertise in NLP research and development.

With the AWS CDK, developers can seamlessly integrate the Hugging Face model into the deployment pipeline. The CDK allows for the easy definition and provisioning of the necessary infrastructure components, such as the SageMaker serverless endpoint and the fixed API Gateway. This streamlines the deployment process, ensuring efficient utilization of the Hugging Face model's capabilities.

By combining the power of the Hugging Face pre-trained model with the scalability and flexibility of the AWS CDK, this project showcases an effective and user-friendly text summarization solution. Users can leverage the pre-trained model to obtain accurate and concise summaries for large volumes of text, while the CDK simplifies the deployment and management of the system.
This project is set up like a standard Python project.  The initialization
process also creates a virtualenv within this project, stored under the `.venv`
directory.  To create the virtualenv it assumes that there is a `python3`
(or `python` for Windows) executable in your path with access to the `venv`
package. If for any reason the automatic creation of the virtualenv fails,
you can create the virtualenv manually.

To manually create a virtualenv on MacOS and Linux:

```
$ python3 -m venv .venv
```

After the init process completes and the virtualenv is created, you can use the following
step to activate your virtualenv.

```
$ source .venv/bin/activate
```

If you are a Windows platform, you would activate the virtualenv like this:

```
% .venv\Scripts\activate.bat
```

Once the virtualenv is activated, you can install the required dependencies.

```
$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```

At this point you can now synthesize the CloudFormation template for this code.

```
$ cdk synth
```

To add additional dependencies, for example other CDK libraries, just add
them to your `setup.py` file and rerun the `pip install -r requirements.txt`
command.

## Useful commands

 * `cdk ls`          list all stacks in the app
 * `cdk synth`       emits the synthesized CloudFormation template
 * `cdk deploy`      deploy this stack to your default AWS account/region
 * `cdk diff`        compare deployed stack with current state
 * `cdk docs`        open CDK documentation

Enjoy!
